# Small-Business-Website--TutorKing

**Overview:**

My sample website, TutorKing, is a modern, clean representation of a tutoring website, mainly aimed but not limited to GCSE students. It was created using Webflow, and includes key features such as clear navigation and a responsive UI.

**Design Goals:**

• 	Highlight subjects and pricing clearly

**What I Learned:**
